# Shortest-Undirected-Distance
This project is an implementation of an algorithm for finding shortest path in an undirected graph. The algorithm was presented in a research paper _Chang, L., Yu, J. X., Qin, L., Cheng, H., & Qiao, M. (2012). The exact distance to destination in undirected world. The VLDB Journal, 21, 869-888._
